# üöÄ API Testing Workshop

This repository contains the materials for a workshop on API testing. The workshop focuses on building and testing a "Friends" API using Python, AWS CDK, Docker, LocalStack, and the OpenAPI specification.

## üìã Requirements

<details>
<summary>Python 3.10</summary>

1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Follow the instructions in the installer to install Python on your system.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running: `python --version`. You should see `Python 3.10.x`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using Poetry: `poetry install`
3. Start LocalStack using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Deploy the API and Lambda functions using AWS CDK: `cdk deploy`

## üéØ Session Objective

The main goal of this session is to implement and test the "Get Specific Friend" endpoint. This endpoint allows users to retrieve information about a specific friend in the Friends API. Participants will learn how to define the API specification using OpenAPI, implement the endpoint using AWS Lambda, and write tests using Python.
